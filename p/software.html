<h4>yass</h4>

<p>
  yass stands for Yet Another Scheduling Simulator. It is written in C
  and is released under the GPL-2 license. It can be
  downloaded <a href="software/yass-0.1.0.tar.bz2">here</a>. Several
  uniprocessor and multiprocessor scheduling algorithms are
  implemented, for example RUN and U-EDF. To build all the scheduling
  algorithms based on LPDPM, you'll need to download cplex and move it
  into the schedulers/cplex/ directory. It can generate random task
  sets and schedule them using different scheduling algorithms but it
  can also schedule individual task sets and output the schedule. For
  example:

<h4>draw</h4>

<p>
  draw is a simple software to build scheduling figures. It can be
  downloaded <a href="software/draw.tar.gz">here</a>, see also
  the <a href="https://github.com/vlegout/draw">github</a>
  repository. It is written in Haskell, is not very intuitive nor
  documented but can produce figures like the one bellow. All the
  scheduling figures in the thesis are built using this program.
