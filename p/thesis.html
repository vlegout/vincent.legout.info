<p>
  My advisors were Mathieu Jan
  and <a href="http://www.infres.enst.fr/~pautet/">Laurent
  Pautet</a>. The title of my thesis is:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Ordonnancement temps réel multiprocesseur pour la réduction<br />
  de la consommation énergétique des systèmes embarqués
</p>

<p>
  And a possible English tranlation:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Energy-aware real-time scheduling of multiprocessor embedded systems
</p>

  The thesis is written in French and can be
  found <a href="these/legout.pdf">here</a>. The slides I used for the
  defense can also be downloaded <a href="these/slides.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
  It was written using LaTeX and the full sources can be downloaded
  <a href="these/these.tar.gz">here</a>. To build it under Debian or
  Ubuntu, you need to install most of the texlive-* packages and at
  least the two following Haskell packages: libghc-cairo-dev and
  libghc-pango-dev.

<!-- <h4>Abstract</h4> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Real-time systems are often used in embedded context. Thus reducing -->
<!--   their energy consumption is a growing concern to increase their -->
<!--   autonomy. In this thesis, we target multiprocessor embedded systems -->
<!--   which are becoming standard and are replacing uniprocessor systems. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   We aim to reduce the energy consumption of the processors which are -->
<!--   the main components of the system. It includes both static and dynamic -->
<!--   consumption and it is now dominated by static consumption as the -->
<!--   semiconductor technology moves to deep sub-micron scale. Existing -->
<!--   solutions mainly focused on dynamic consumption. On the other hand, we -->
<!--   target static consumption by efficiently using the low-power states of -->
<!--   the processors. In a low-power state, the processor is not active and -->
<!--   the deeper the low-power state is, the lower is the energy consumption -->
<!--   but the higher is the transition delay to come back to the active -->
<!--   state. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   In this thesis, we propose new optimal multiprocessor real-time -->
<!--   scheduling algorithms. They optimize the duration of the idle periods -->
<!--   to activate the most appropriate low-power states. We target hard -->
<!--   real-time systems with periodic tasks and also mixed-criticality -->
<!--   systems where tasks with lower criticalities can tolerate deadline -->
<!--   misses, therefore allowing us to be more aggressive while trying to -->
<!--   reduce the energy consumption. Offline, we use an additional task to -->
<!--   model the idle time and we use mixed integer linear programming to -->
<!--   compute a schedule minimizing the energy consumption. Online, we -->
<!--   extend an existing scheduling algorithm to increase the length of the -->
<!--   existing idle periods. To the best of our knowledge, these are the -->
<!--   first optimal multiprocessor scheduling algorithms minimizing the -->
<!--   static energy consumption. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Evaluations have been performed using existing optimal multiprocessor -->
<!--   real-time scheduling algorithms. Results show that the energy -->
<!--   consumption while processors are idle is up to ten times reduced with -->
<!--   our solutions compared to the existing multiprocessor real-time -->
<!--   scheduling algorithms. -->
